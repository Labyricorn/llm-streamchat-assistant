# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LLM StreamChat Assistant is a Python-based system that enhances existing Twitch and YouTube streaming bots with AI-powered chat responses. The system integrates with local LLM backends to provide intelligent, configurable chat interactions while maintaining low latency and high reliability for live streaming environments.

## Glossary

- **StreamChat_Assistant**: The main system that coordinates chat monitoring, LLM processing, and response generation
- **Chat_Monitor**: Component responsible for connecting to and monitoring Twitch and YouTube chat streams
- **LLM_Backend**: Local language model server (Ollama, LM Studio, or Lemonade AI Server)
- **Web_Dashboard**: Flask-based web interface for system control and configuration
- **Configuration_Manager**: Component that handles loading and updating system settings from config.yml

- **Response_Generator**: Component that processes LLM outputs and formats them for chat platforms

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a streamer, I want the assistant to connect to Twitch and/or YouTube chat based on my configuration, so that I can engage with audiences on my preferred platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHERE Twitch is enabled in configuration, THE Chat_Monitor SHALL establish connection to Twitch chat via twitchio
2. WHERE YouTube is enabled in configuration, THE Chat_Monitor SHALL establish connection to YouTube live chat via pytchat
3. THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL support running with only Twitch enabled, only YouTube enabled, or both platforms enabled simultaneously
4. WHILE connected to any enabled chat platform, THE Chat_Monitor SHALL continuously monitor incoming messages from those platforms
5. IF a connection to any enabled platform fails, THEN THE Chat_Monitor SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
6. THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL process messages from all connected platforms using the same LLM processing pipeline
7. WHEN sending responses, THE Response_Generator SHALL route messages to the appropriate platform based on message origin

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a streamer, I want to configure the assistant's personality and behavior through a config file, so that I can customize responses to match my streaming style.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL load all settings from a config.yml file at system startup
2. WHEN personality presets are defined in config.yml, THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL apply the selected personality to all LLM interactions
3. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL support configurable response frequency settings to control how often the assistant responds to chat messages
4. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL support configurable response types including conversational, informational, humorous, and supportive response modes
5. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL support configurable response length limits including short, medium, and long response formats
6. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL support additional system prompt guidance fields for custom instructions and behavioral modifications
7. WHEN model selection is specified in config.yml, THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL use the designated LLM model for all responses
8. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL validate all configuration parameters and provide clear error messages for invalid settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a streamer, I want the assistant to work with my preferred local LLM backend, so that I can maintain control over my AI processing without relying on external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL support individual connections to Ollama REST API, LM Studio OpenAI-compatible API, and Lemonade AI Server API
2. WHEN Ollama is configured as the LLM_Backend, THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL connect via HTTP requests to the Ollama generate endpoint
3. WHEN LM Studio is configured as the LLM_Backend, THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL connect via OpenAI-compatible API calls to the LM Studio server
4. WHEN Lemonade AI Server is configured as the LLM_Backend, THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL connect via the Lemonade AI Server's native API protocol
5. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL validate LLM backend connectivity during startup and provide specific error messages for each backend type
6. THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL send chat context and personality instructions to the selected LLM_Backend for response generation
7. WHEN the LLM_Backend returns a response, THE Response_Generator SHALL process and format the output for chat delivery
8. IF the LLM_Backend becomes unavailable, THEN THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL log the error and continue monitoring chat without sending responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a streamer, I want a web dashboard to control and monitor the assistant, so that I can manage the system without interrupting my stream.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Web_Dashboard SHALL provide start and stop controls for both Twitch and YouTube chat bots
2. THE Web_Dashboard SHALL include a live prompt testing interface for validating LLM responses before going live
3. WHILE the system is running, THE Web_Dashboard SHALL display real-time logs of chat messages and assistant responses
4. THE Web_Dashboard SHALL provide an interface for editing configuration settings including personality, response rate, and model selection
5. WHEN configuration changes are made through the Web_Dashboard, THE Configuration_Manager SHALL apply updates without requiring system restart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a streamer, I want the assistant to respond to chat with minimal delay, so that conversations feel natural and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat message is received, THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL process and respond within 3 seconds under normal conditions
2. THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL use async processing for all chat monitoring and LLM communication to prevent blocking
3. THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL implement request queuing to handle multiple simultaneous chat messages efficiently
4. WHEN response frequency limits are configured, THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL respect timing constraints while maintaining responsiveness
5. THE StreamChat_Assistant SHALL prioritize recent messages when processing queued requests
